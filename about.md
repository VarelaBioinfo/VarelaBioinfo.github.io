# Alfredo Varela Vega 

I am an undergraduate student at the **Genomics** program of the **National Autonomus University of Mexico** with a four year background of medical studies acquired at School of medicine of the same institution. I am fueled by my passion for understanding **olfaction** and **memory** at the genomics and transcriptomics level under the **bioinformatics** lense and applying that knowledge to the deeper understanding of neurodegenerative disorders.
