# Alfredo Varela Vega 

## Nice to meet you!

As a Bioinformatician with a B.Sc. in Genomic Sciences from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), my goal is to transcend the boundaries across diverse data modalities, including omics technologies, electronic health records, wearable biosensors, biomedical literature, and environmental information. My mission is to reshape the frontiers of personalized healthcare by seamlessly integrating and interpreting this wealth of data. Through these efforts, I envision contributing to a new era of healthcare that elevates the quality of life for each unique individual.

In my spare time I love to analyze all kind of interesting datasets. Particularly, I'm interested in sports data due to my undeniable passion for them. 

> Isn't it spectacular how the perspective of the game changes under the sports analytics lens?

To accomplish my work, I mainly use R and Python. The former being my favorite for data visualization and modeling, the latter where I've carried out most of my predictive analysis using machine learning.

Apart from sports & data science, I love reading, [coffee brewing](https://twitter.com/fikandatautoma), exploring my sense of smell and running.
