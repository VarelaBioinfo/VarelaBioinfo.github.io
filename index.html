introduction: |
  In Swedish culture, fika more than just a coffee break is an attitude or a state of mind. A real life necessity, a moment to relax and just be present, take a pause and socialise. With this in mind it would be really special for me to be part of your fika. Maybe as a friend that tells you something intresting about science or data anlysis one day and another that talks you about his love for coffee. At least, you will find here a good conversation topic to fika.     

  Topics you can expect:

  - Omic sciences (Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics)
  - Neuroscience
  - Medical science
  - Coding 
  - Data analysis
  - Data science 
  - Coffee science 
  - Coffee
