introduction: |
  In Swedish culture, fika more than just a coffee break is an attitude or a state of mind. A real life necessity, a moment to relax and just be present, take a pause and socialise. With this in mind it would be really special for me to be part of your fika. Maybe as a friend that tells you something interesting about science, data science or data anlysis one day and at another time talks to you about his love for coffee. At least, you will find here a good conversation topic to fika.     

  Topics you can expect:

  - Omic sciences (Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics)
  - Neuroscience
  - Medical science
  - Coding 
  - Data analysis
  - Data science 
  - Coffee science 
  - Coffee
