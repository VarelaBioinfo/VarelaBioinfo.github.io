With the next Hungarian GP taking place, Red Bull Racing Honda is
leading the 2021 Constructor Standings by only 4 points. In the haunt is
Mercedes with their two drivers Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas,
placing 2nd and 4th respectively in the Driver Standings.

After a controversial accident in Silverstone leaving Verstappen out of
the race, Red Bull’s pilot is still leading the Driver Standings. In the
other hand, his teammate Sergio Pérez could only steal Mercedes the
extra point awarded for fastest lap, leaving him in the 5th position
just 9 points away from 3rd place.

Given that Red Bull and Mercedes drivers are fighting both
Championships, let’s analyze their results in the races 2015-2020.

## Web Scraping using rvest

First, we will scrape the data from [formula 1 official
site](https://www.formula1.com/en.html).

``` r
# scrape data from web pages 
library(rvest)
# for removing the span nodes
library(xml2)
# Cleaning and transforming data
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
# Data visualization 
library(ggplot2)
```

Checking if we can manage to correctly extract 2020 table using its URL.

``` r
# Converting to xml
hungary_test_2020<-read_html("https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2020/races/1047/hungary/race-result.html")

# Extracting table tags and transforming them into a list of data frames  
h_results_2020 <- hungary_test_2020 %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>%
  html_table()

h_results_2020<-h_results_2020[[1]]

h_results_2020
```

Now we create the function that will let us extract all the race results
tables from 2015-2020. We just pass to the function a vector with all
the URLs.

``` r
# Extract tables from html and transform it to tibble 
get_f1_table<-function(url){
  xml_doc<- read_html(url)
  list_result <- xml_doc %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>%
  html_table()
  table_result<-list_result[[1]]
  return(table_result)  
}


# Vector with the race results URLs from 2020-2015
hungarian_urls<-c("https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2020/races/1047/hungary/race-result.html","https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2019/races/1011/hungary/race-result.html","https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2018/races/990/hungary/race-result.html","https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/969/hungary/race-result.html","https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2016/races/947/hungary/race-result.html","https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2015/races/927/hungary/race-result.html")

# Each element of the list is a yearly result
results_2020_2015<- lapply(hungarian_urls, FUN = get_f1_table)

# year 2020 
hungary_2020<- results_2020_2015[[1]]
```

## Data preparation

Getting rid of empty columns, cleaning drivers name and creating a
single data frame for all the race results

``` r
cleaning_f1_results<-function(year_df){
  year_df <- year_df %>% 
    select(Pos:PTS)
  year_df$Driver<-gsub("\n","",year_df$Driver)
  return(year_df)
}
# Cleaning all tables
results_2020_2015<- lapply(results_2020_2015, FUN = cleaning_f1_results)
results_2020_2015[[1]]
```

## Data visualization and analysis

Interestingly, in 2015 when Max Verstappen was driving the STR Renault
he managed to end 2 places ahead of Lewis Hamilton. Doing so in a year
when Hamilton secured 10 victories and Mercedes finished first with 703
points in the Constructor Standings. That year, the STR Renault team
would finish 7th with 67 points. Without a doubt an early view to Max’s
bright future. In that same year, Sergio Perez would not finish the race
due to a massive [accident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLztchb138)
where he ended upside down in his Force India Mercedes.

2016 was the year that Max will debut with Red Bull and also the first
of four wins for Lewis Hamilton in this 6 year window, finishing in P1
in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Max would only reach the second place in
the last two Grand prix. It all seems to come into place for Lewis when
he drives in the Hungaroring. Even when things do not go so well like in
the 2017 where he ended almost securing the 3rd position but in a
sportsmanship act he let his teammate Valtteri Bottas to pass him ending
the race with much more than just another podium, admiration and respect
from the audience.

``` r
ggplot(all_races, aes(x = year, y = Pos, group = Short_name, color = Short_name)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(all_races$Short_name =="VER"|all_races$Short_name=="HAM"|all_races$Short_name=="PER"|all_races$Short_name=="BOT") +

With his permanence in the team for next year still in doubt, a solid
performance for Sergio Pérez is mandatory if he wants to claim back the
3rd place in the 2021 Driver’s Championship and give no reasons to hold
back the contract to Red Bull. While we analyze his performance in this
five year window we should take into consideration that this is his
first year in Red Bull Racing Honda and probably the first year that he
is driving for a real title contender team as opposed to the other
drivers in the current analysis which in the worst of cases had been
driving in top teams since 2017.

Fortunately, Sergio Pérez reached his best performance in the last Grand
Prix finishing in 7th place, the year when he had the Racing Point BWT
Mercedes, arguably his most competitive car prior to the
[RB16](https://www.redbull.com/int-es/redbullracing/cars). Now with a
better car it seems realistic to have a good starting position as in
2020 where he was 4th. Hopefully this time, he can hold on to it till
the end of the race and fight for a podium position.
